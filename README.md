# Counter
This is just a simple webpage with a counter made for the JavaScript basics project on Start2Impact.
All the counter's elements (except the div container) have been implemented through the script counter.js.

# How I made it work
To make the counter work I just added an onclick event to the plus and minus buttons with the respectives simple functions.
